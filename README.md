# Cloud-Based-PE-Malware-Detection-API

---

**Project Overview:**

This project focuses on implementing and deploying a machine learning model for detecting malware in Portable Executable (PE) files using a cloud-based API. The project is divided into three main tasks:

Task 1. **Building and Training the Model**: This involves creating and training a deep neural network based on the MalConv architecture using the EMBER-2017 v2 dataset.

Task 2. **Deploying the Model as a Cloud API**: This involves deploying the trained model on Amazon SageMaker to create an endpoint (API) for other applications to utilize.

Task 3. **Creating a Client Application**: A web application was developed using Streamlit, where users can upload PE files for analysis. The application converts the files into feature vectors compatible with the model, runs them on the cloud API, and displays the results.

**File Structure:**

- **/Task1**: This directory contains
  - `Midterm Project Colab Redone.ipynb, file specifically used to complete task 1 (Building and training the model).
  - `malconv_model.h5`- Extracted model.
  - `model_epoch_5.pt`, `model_epoch_10.pt`, `model_epoch_15.pt`- all obtained after training the dataset.
  - Some sampled datasets. Due to file size limitation, sampled X train and sampled X test, couldn't be uploaded.

- **/Task2**: Here, you'll find a notebook file, an inference script, and MalConv model artifacts.
  - `Deployment2.ipynb`: Notebook file used to deploy the model.
  - `entry_point_script.py`: Inference script associated with the deployment code.
  - `malconv_model.tar.gz`
  - malconv_model_state.pth

- **/Task3**: This directory holds: 
  - `ClientAPP.py`: Script used to launch the web app using streamlit.
  - 'Cloud_API(1).ipynb': Notebook used to setup the web app.

- **Midterm project AI and Cybersec REPORT.pdf**: Contains the project report detailing the technical approach, performance analysis, and references.
  - `Project_Report.pdf`

- **Link to presentation**: Includes a link to the YouTube presentation and demo video.
  - `Presentation_Demo_Video_Link.txt`
